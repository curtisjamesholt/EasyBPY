# EasyBPY
A module to simplify the use of the Blender Python API.

The purpose of the EasyBPY module is to simplify the use of the Blender API by creating an extra layer of abstraction that is more human-readable, memorable and reduces the userâ€™s exposure to complex code paths.

EasyBPY can be added to Blender by installing it into the (../scripts/modules) folder in the user preferences (AppData). The file can also be re-packaged with any other addon, so long as the developer respects the limitations of the GPL license.

For a visual introduction, please watch the [announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybnapDe4-Ts).

You can either grab the file from here on GitHub, or alternatively on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/easybpy).
